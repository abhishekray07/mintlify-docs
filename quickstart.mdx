## Setup Opslane

Follow these steps to set up Opslane and start improving your on-call experience.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Docker installed on your system
- A Slack workspace
- A Datadog account
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered features)
- Ngrok account (for external URL setup)

### Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the repository">
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the Opslane repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/opslane/opslane.git
    cd opslane
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Set up external URL with Ngrok">
    Opslane requires an external URL accessible from the internet for features like Slack integration and Datadog webhooks. We'll use Ngrok to create this URL.

    1. Sign up for a free Ngrok account at [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) if you haven't already.
    2. Install Ngrok following their [installation guide](https://ngrok.com/download).
    3. Authenticate Ngrok with your account token:
    ```bash
    ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
    ```
    4. Start your ngrok tunnel

    The ngrok tunnel should point to port 8001 (where the API server will run):

    ```bash
    ngrok http --subdomain=xxx --host-header=rewrite 8001 --region us
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configure environment variables">
    1. Copy the example environment file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    2. Leave the dummy values for now. We will come back and update them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="docker" title="Build and run with Docker">
    Build and run the Opslane Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will start Opslane. Before we can get the alert classification to work,
    we need to get the Slack and Datadog integrations to work.

## Start Using Opslane

Before using Opslane, e want to index the slack channels that have the alert history as well as annotate 25 alerts to generate a model.

To do these run the following commands:

1. `docker ps` to find out the id of the `app` container.

2. `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash`

3. Index Slack content: `python -m app.scripts.seed_data`

4. Classify Datadog alerts: `python -m app.ml.training.train_alert_classifier --num-alerts 20`

5. Opslane is ready to use. Any future datadog alerts will be annotated!
